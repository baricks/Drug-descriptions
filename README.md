A computer program written in Python that mimics the language used by pharmaceutical drug companies to sell their products. Using the FDA's API at api.fda.gov, I wrote a code in which users input their disease or their disorder and then the program suggests a drug based on those symptoms. The drug itself is a jumbled-up version of what would actually be prescribed for such a disorder.
